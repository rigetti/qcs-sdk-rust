# Intro

Welcome to the QCS SDK book ðŸ‘‹. This SDK is all about running quantum programs on [Rigetti's QCS Platform][QCS]. There are three different SDKs today:

1. [pyQuil] is the original Python SDK, the reference implementation for interacting with QCS.
2. [The Rust SDK][docs.rs] is on crates.io.
3. The C SDK is a thin wrapper around the Rust SDK that exposes the public API through C FFI. That documentation is right here!
