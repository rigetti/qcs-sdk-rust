 *
 * # Usage
 *
 * In order to execute, you must have an active reservation for the QPU you're targeting.
 *
 * ## Configuration
 *
 * Valid settings and secrets must be set either in ~/.qcs or by setting the OS environment
 * variables `QCS_SECRETS_FILE_PATH` and `QCS_SETTINGS_FILE_PATH` for secrets and settings
 * respectively. `QCS_PROFILE_NAME` can also be used to choose a different profile in those

 * # Errors

 * This program will return a [`crate::ExecutionResult::Error`] if an error occurs.
