class ResultData:
    """
    Represents the two possible types of data returned from either the QVM or a real QPU.
    Each variant contains the original data returned from its respective executor.

    Usage
    -----

    Your usage of ``ResultData`` will depend on the types of programs you are running and where.
    The `to_register_map()` method will attempt to build ``RegisterMap`` out of the data, where each
    register name is mapped to a 2-dimensional rectangular ``RegisterMatrix`` where each row
    represents the final values in each register index for a particular shot. This is often the
    desired form of the data and it is _probably_ what you want. This transformation isn't always
    possible, in which case `to_register_map()` will return an error.

    To understand why this transformation can fail, we need to understand a bit about how readout data is
    returned from the QVM and from a real QPU:

    The QVM treats each `DECLARE` statement as initialzing some amount of memory. This memory works
    as one might expect it to. It is zero-initalized, and subsequent writes to the same region
    overwrite the previous value. The QVM returns memory at the end of every shot. This means
    we get the last value in every memory reference for each shot, which is exactly the
    representation we want for a ``RegisterMatrix``. For this reason, `to_register_map()` should
    always succeed for ``ResultData::Qvm``.

    The QPU on the other hand doesn't use the same memory model as the QVM. Each memory reference
    (ie. "ro[0]") is more like a stream than a value in memory. Every `MEASURE` to a memory
    reference emits a new value to said stream. This means that the number of values per memory
    reference can vary per shot. For this reason, it's not always clear what the final value in
    each shot was for a particular reference. When this is the case, `to_register_map()` will return
    an error as it's impossible to build a correct ``RegisterMatrix``  from the data without
    knowing the intent of the program that was run. Instead, it's recommended to build the
    ``RegisterMatrix`` you need from the inner ``QPUResultData`` data using the knowledge of your
    program to choose the correct readout values for each shot.

    Variants:
        - ``qvm``: Data returned from the QVM, stored as ``QVMResultData``
        - ``qpu``: Data returned from the QPU, stored as ``QPUResultData``

    Methods (each per variant):
        - ``is_*``: if the underlying values are that type.
        - ``as_*``: if the underlying values are that type, then those values, otherwise ``None``.
        - ``to_*``: the underlying values as that type, raises ``ValueError`` if they are not.
        - ``from_*``: wrap underlying values as this enum type.

        Convert ``ResultData`` from its inner representation as ``QVMResultData`` or

        Errors
        ------

        Raises a ``RegisterMatrixConversionError`` if the inner execution data for any of the
        registers would result in a jagged matrix. ``QPUResultData`` data is captured per measure,
        meaning a value is returned for every measure to a memory reference, not just once per shot.
        This is often the case in programs that use mid-circuit measurement or dynamic control flow,
        where measurements to the same memory reference might occur multiple times in a shot, or be
        skipped conditionally. In these cases, building a rectangular ``RegisterMatrix`` would
        necessitate making assumptions about the data that could skew the data in undesirable ways.
        Instead, it's recommended to manually build a matrix from ``QPUResultData`` that accurately
        selects the last value per-shot based on the program that was run.
