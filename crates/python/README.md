# QCS SDK Python

`qcs-sdk-python` is an interface to Rigetti's [Quantum Cloud Services](https://docs.rigetti.com/qcs/) (QCS). Allowing users
to compile Quil programs using (quilc)[https://github.com/rigetti/quilc] and run them on real quantum processors.

While this package could be used directly, [pyQuil](https://pypi.org/project/pyquil/) offers more functionality and a 
higher-level interface for building and executing Quil programs. This package is still in early development and breaking
changes should be expected. Eventually, some fucntionality of `pyQuil` will be powered by this package.
