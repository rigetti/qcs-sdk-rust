# QCS Rust SDK

The `qcs` crate is a high-level interface to Rigetti's [Quantum Cloud Services], allowing Rust developers to run [Quil] programs on Rigetti's [QPUs]. This crate is a Rust port of [`pyQuil`], though it currently has a much smaller feature set.

## Documentation

This crate is documented primarily via [rustdoc] comments and examples, which are available on [docs.rs].
